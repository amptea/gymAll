Problem Motivation
With an endless stream of distractions in our lives, it has become increasingly difficult for the average person to remain committed to fitness and exercise. From a lack of discipline to a lack of motivation, there are many factors deterring individuals from exercising consistently. Specifically, we are focussing on gymming, and the struggles faced by many individuals in maintaining a consistent, effective and motivated gym routine.

User Stories

- As a gym user, I want to track the workouts I have completed and keep a record of my progress towards my fitness goals.
- As a beginner I am unaware of workouts I can do, and can lead to burnout and prevent me from continuing to gym, so I would benefit from being able - to see targeted workout recommendations to give me an idea of where to start.
- As an intermediate lifter, I would be more than enthused to have all my other gym-going friends together on one application, allowing us to plan - when to gym together, and even coordinate our splits/workouts, making gym plans highly efficient.
- As a fitness oriented person aiming to reach a certain goal within a time frame, I would need to remain consistent and motivated. By being able to “compete” with my friends in a friendly leaderboard system, and complete monthly challenges, I would be more extrinsically motivated to keep on target.
- As a health and weight conscious individual, I would want a calorie tracker to bulk/cut (gain mass/lose mass) more efficiently, based on whether I am on a caloric surplus, or caloric deficit.

Core Features
Tracking workouts:

- Users can choose from a wide range of exercises, and log their exercises, sets, reps and weights into their completed activities.
- Allows beginners and intermediate gym users to keep track of their workout activity more easily
- Users can check their workout history to remember what workout they have done, and remember details of any specific workout

Workout routines:

- Users can save frequently performed routines, and start a saved routine with the click of a button.
- New gym users can easily remember new workouts they pickup, and do not have to waste time inputting the exercises and other information each time they workout. This reduces the inertia needed to start a new workout.
- Frequent gym users can save lots of time and effort for routines that they do consistently, and allows them to start their workout the moment they hit the gym

Leaderboard:

- Users can rank up against their friends or other users in the community (Based on METs - Metabolic Equivalents of Task, or other possible metrics).
- All gym users can gain extrinsic motivation from comparing their statistics/workouts against their peers; easy to boost their motivation quickly and continue working out

Recommendations:

- Based on individual user’s goal, we can recommend specific workouts and number of sets/reps/weights to complete in order to accomplish the goal.
- Beginners can easily find new workout routines they can try out, instead of having to search through multiple sources online. They can pick one workout that seems interesting to them and start immediately
- Intermediate gym users can mix up their routine and even learn new exercises by exploring recommended workouts to keep the routine fresh

Schedule:

- Set up a schedule on when to go to the gym. “Friends” connected on the app are also able to track when they are able to gym, as well as what exercises they plan to do, allowing for greater convenience and planning.
- Users can coordinate with their friends more easily and motivate each other along their fitness journey

Calorie tracker:

- Users can track calorie intake and calories burnt (through workouts), and visualise the ideal input/output to reach a certain weight or muscle mass goal.

Activities:

- View recently completed activities by yourself and other followed users, with the option to interact with other users on the activities.
